# WGMS - Giulio's repository of tasks

## Description
Here you can find all the information about what I have worked on from Nov 2023 to Dec 2024 at the WGMS. The main two tasks I worked on are the Country Profiles and the Glacier Profiles. In each you will find:
- The necessary input files
- Scripts
- Description on how to run each task
I also worked on submitting data to the WGMS database from published scientific articles and data enhancements using the new features of the database.
